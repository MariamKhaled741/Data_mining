 Crime Data Clustering – Data Mining Project

This project was part of our **Data Mining** course, where we applied **KMeans** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques to analyze and group crime data.


 Project Overview
We explored a crime dataset and used clustering methods to discover hidden patterns and crime categories.

 Techniques Used
- **KMeans Clustering**: Grouped crimes based on features like location, time, and severity  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Visualized relationships between data points using dendrograms

 Outcomes
- Identified crime clusters and trends
- Gained insight into crime behavior based on similarity
- Hands-on experience in applying unsupervised learning methods

 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy

 Files
- `clustering_kmeans_hierarchical.ipynb` – main analysis notebook  
- `crime_data.csv` – dataset used  
- `output/` – contains plots and visualizations
